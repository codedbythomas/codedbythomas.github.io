        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <h3>Highschools</h3>
        <p>I will be choosing highschools to be going to soon. My first choices are of Millikan or Lakewood Highschool for the ATM programs that they have there as I want to continue being in the ATM programs. I may also go to McBride for the engineering programs that they have there however the ATM program is something I want to keep doing and am probably going to Millikan or Lakewood.</p>

        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>For colleges, I haven't really thought of any I want to go to as it hasn't really concerned me yet. But as I move into highschool, I may very soon begin to look for a college to go to based around what I'd want to do for a career. But for right now, it probably doesn't really matter for right now until I move into 11th and 12th grade.</p>
        <h3>Possible Careers</h3>
        <p>Speaking of careers, there are a few that I may want to have in future. These include becoming an engineer, an arcitect, or a computer programer to make a living in the future. The reasons why I would like to hve one of these careers is because I like to build things and machines from many different parts an objects as well as use and code with computers.</p>
