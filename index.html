        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Family</h3>
            <p>My family consists of me, my mom, dad, and grandfather as well as our pets. My mom and dad both work for the same company and my grandfather does most of the handy work around the house. 
                My mom's parents came from China to the U.S. and was the only one of her siblings to be born here. 
                My dad's family came to the U.S. many generations ago from Ireland and Denmark and later moved to the west coast to escape the cold climate of Minnesota and Eastern U.S. in general.
                My name is Thomas and I am in the ATM program at my current school and really enjoy it.
            </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>During the time of being in the ATM program I have learned many different sets of skills relating to computers. Some of the skills that I have obtained are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to use Photoshop</li>
            <li>Knowing how to code sites (CSS and HTML)</li>

        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Some of the things that I like to do in my free time are building things like buildings and machines out of Lego bricks and parts. I also enjoy playing video games on the computer as well as watch tv and videos on my phone.</p>
        <h3>Awards Received</h3>
        <p>Knowing that grades are important for the schools people want to get into, I've done my best to keep them up and as a result have gotten rewards. 
            I have gotten awards like Principal's Honor Roll, High School Readiness, Perfect Attendance, and have gotten into a school Jeopardy tournament all years that it's been available.
