        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Family</h3>
        <p>My family consists of me, my mom, dad, and grandfather as well as our pets. My mom and dad both work for the same company and my grandfather does most of the handy work around the house. 
            My mom's parents came from China to the U.S. and was the only one of her siblings to be born here. 
            My dad's family came to the U.S. many generations ago from Ireland and Denmark and later moved to the west coast to escape the cold.</p>
